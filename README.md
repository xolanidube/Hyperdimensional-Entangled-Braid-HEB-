# Hyperdimensional Entangled Braid (HEB)

## Overview

The HEB is a theoretical, breakthrough-level data structure designed to explore new frontiers in data structure complexity. It attempts to leverage hyperdimensional embeddings and fractal hashing to reduce search and insertion complexities to below standard logarithmic bounds, at least in theory.

## Mathematical Background

We define a fractal hash:

$$ h(k) = (h_1(k), h_2(k), \ldots, h_\ell(k)) $$

Each coordinate is derived by repeatedly modding a hash value by a branch factor. Keys are placed at nodes determined by these coordinates.

We hypothesize improved complexity, such as:

$$ \text{Complexity} \approx O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log(\log n)}\right) $$

though no formal proof is provided here.

## Implementation Details

- `insert(key, value)`: Inserts a key by navigating to a node determined by fractal coordinates.
- `search(key)`: Searches similarly.

This code is a conceptual prototype, not a fully realized data structure.

## Potential Real-World Applications

- Ultra-fast lookups in massive databases.
- Rapid indexing in large-scale directory structures.
- High-frequency financial data retrieval.
- Accelerated network routing table lookups.

## Validation

We perform academic-level testing: insert a few keys, verify retrieval correctness. Complexity benefits are not empirically tested.

## Usage
